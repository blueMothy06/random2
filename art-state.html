  <h1>Hey, you made it!</h1>
  <p>I enjoy telling stories, so it's no surprise that I added a sense of a narrative
    here as well. It started off as a scenario generator (and it still technically
    is) with a bunch of different things I thought were funny. Then as I started
    working on it, I decided to make the audience step into the shoes of the
    very person my colorful passerby recognize.
    <br>
    I considered making this entire project overwhelming and a bit stressful to
    simulate how stressed out the main character was feeling, but at the end,
    I decided to keep it short and simple, since the more serious atmosphere
    didn't match the goofiness of the scenarios presented.

  <p>Background is <i>Parade de cirque</i> by Georges Seurat, though I did tint
    it darker to make things stand out better.
